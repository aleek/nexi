<a name="chap:microprogramming"></a></p><h2 class="section"><a name="toc5"></a><a name="htoc7">1.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</h2><p>We will start this module with a quick look back at some earlier
implementation techniques. This is partly to set the scene, and
partly to explain the background of some later developments (which
were initially controversial).</p><p>The control parts of computers prior to the mid 60s were constructed,
essentially, of electronic components structured into logic gates. It
was quickly discovered that building computers, especially the
<i>control logic</i>, was complex and error-prone — hence
techniques were developed to further structure systems and reduce
errors. Nevertheless, it was still difficult and complex, and errors
were hard to fix.</p><p>In 1957 Maurice Wilkes<sup><a name="text2" href="http://euler.mat.uson.mx/~havillam/ca/CS323/0708.cs-323003.html#note2">1</a></sup>
proposed an alternative called `microprogramming'. At the time, it
was highly impractical, but in 1964 IBM launched its 360 range, most
of which used this microprogramming concept. Only the top of the
range machine was not microprogrammed, because microprogramming could
not deliver the required performance (traditional methods, for all
their faults, were fast). The 360 series were highly significant
machines in the 60s, and their influence on machine architicture
design is still visible today, particularly in Intel 80x86 and
Motorola 680x0 processors, whose instruction sets are essentially
evolutions of the 360 original. In fact, IBM still produces
mainframes today that use the same architecture.</p><p>Wilkes' idea was that each machine instruction was divided into a
number of sub-instructions, or <i>microinstructions</i>. While
a real instruction (we might say <i>macroinstruction</i>) might
be something like `add the contents of registers <tt>A</tt> and
<tt>B</tt>', a microinstruction might be something like `write
out register <tt>A</tt> to bus <tt>Z</tt>', or `read data bus into
register <tt>X</tt>' — very basic actions that could be assembled to
implement the actual instruction set of the machine. The set of
microinstructions that made up a full instruction set was called the
<i>microprogram</i>, or <i>microcode</i>.</p><h2 class="section"><a name="toc6"></a><a name="htoc8">1.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;How it Works</h2><p>The precise details of Wilkes' design are not important to us, but we
note the following:</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">It was based on a memory consisting of a network of diodes.</li><li class="li-itemize">It was far too expensive at the time it was suggested, because
of the size of the diode array required.</li><li class="li-itemize">The arrival of cheap<sup><a name="text3" href="http://euler.mat.uson.mx/~havillam/ca/CS323/0708.cs-323003.html#note3">2</a></sup> <i>ferrite core</i> memory, and then
semi-conductor memory, changed this and made the idea viable.</li><li class="li-itemize">Even so, unfortunately, the scheme as proposed by Wilkes would
not work for technical reasons, and had to be modified
slightly…</li></ul><p>The idea is that each microinstruction will be divided up into
<i>two</i> parts — the <i>control</i> part, which controls
the operation of the datapath (or data unit), and the
<i>address</i> part, which is the address of the next
microinstruction to be executed <i>under certain conditions</i>.</p><blockquote class="figure"><div class="center"><hr width="80%" size="2"></div>

<div class="center"><hr width="80%" size="2"></div></blockquote><p>Consider figure <a href="http://euler.mat.uson.mx/~havillam/ca/CS323/0708.cs-323003.html#fig:mproc1">1.1</a>. After executing a particular
microinstruction, the next microinstruction to be executed is
<i>either</i> that specified by the address field of the current
microinstruction, or the <i>next sequential</i> microinstruction (as
in a conventional machine language) depending on the value of the
conditional inputs. In addition, when one sequence of
microinstructions has finished, the next is determined by the contents
of the machine instruction register.</p><p>In fact, the situation is usually slightly more complex than this —
there is usually a <i>sequencing</i> part to the microinstruction in
addition to the control and address parts. The sequencing information
is used, for example, to decide which of several conditional inputs is
to be used to control branching. Usually we require unconditional
branching as well, and also many microinstructions do not require
branching at all.</p><p>Consequently the situation is slightly more complex than that shown in
figure <a href="http://euler.mat.uson.mx/~havillam/ca/CS323/0708.cs-323003.html#fig:mproc1">1.1</a>.</p><p>Further refinements are possible — for example, some systems allow
<i>two</i> addresses in the microinstruction, and use conditions to
select between them, rather than selecting between one address and the
next sequential address. Such systems are called <i>two-address
microinstruction controllers</i>, or <i>sequencers</i>. Conversely,
the type shown in figure <a href="http://euler.mat.uson.mx/~havillam/ca/CS323/0708.cs-323003.html#fig:mproc1">1.1</a> is a
<i>single-address controller</i>. It is also common to find
<i>subroutines</i>, usually somewhat rudimentary.</p><h2 class="section"><a name="toc7"></a><a name="htoc9">1.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Morphology</h2><p>The format of the control part of a microinstruction allows us to
classify microinstructions into <i>horizontal</i> and
<i>vertical</i>. The datapath is controlled by a number of control
signals, supplied by the controller. The question is, how do we map
the required control signals onto the control word?</p><blockquote class="figure"><div class="center"><hr width="80%" size="2"></div>
<img src="./Microprogramming_files/0708.cs-323002.png">

</tbody></table></div>
<a name="fig:mprogmorph"></a>
<div class="center"><hr width="80%" size="2"></div></blockquote><h3 class="subsection"><a name="htoc10">1.3.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Fully horizontal microcode</h3><p>The simplest solution would be to assign each control signal a single
bit in the control word — see figure <a href="http://euler.mat.uson.mx/~havillam/ca/CS323/0708.cs-323003.html#fig:mprogmorph">1.2</a>(a).</p><p>This is <i>fully-horizontal microcode</i>. It has the obvious
disadvantage that not all control signals in the datapath will ever be
activated simultaneously, thus requiring much wider microcode words
than is necessary. Microcode words are commonly wide anyway — of
the order of 100 bits or more. If a datapath has many control
signals, it could be very much wider with horizontal microcode.</p><p>However, it does have the advantages that many datapath signals can be
activated simultaneously, thus maximising potential parallelism; and
there is no extra hardware between controller and datapath, which
could slow down the processor. Therefore, horizontal microcode is
potentially fast.</p><h3 class="subsection"><a name="htoc11">1.3.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Fully vertical microcode</h3><p>In <i>fully-vertical microcode</i>, the control signals are
fully-encoded in the control word — that is, if for example a
datapath had 16 control signals, these would be encoded as four bits:
see figure <a href="http://euler.mat.uson.mx/~havillam/ca/CS323/0708.cs-323003.html#fig:mprogmorph">1.2</a>(b).</p><p>This saves on the microcode memory needed, but removes any possibility
for parallelism and adds a decoder between the controller and the
datapath.</p><p>As well as delaying the signals, the decoder will consume some of the
space/resources saved by reducing the size of the microcode memory.
This is an example of a time-space tradeoff.</p><h3 class="subsection"><a name="htoc12">1.3.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Morphology in practice</h3><p>In practice, neither extreme is seen — some degree of encoding of
the datapath signals is always done, and some parallel operation is
allowed.</p><p>In practice, not all possible parallel activities are useful; <i>e.g.</i>&nbsp;there is no point in writing more than one register to the same bus
(<i>i.e.</i>&nbsp;performing more than one register read) at the same time.</p><p>Therefore, it makes sense to work out what useful combinations of
parallel actions exist and allow these.</p><p>How can we design a microinstruction format to control the data unit?
Each register needs two control signals to indicate reading and
writing from/to the bus.</p><blockquote class="figure"><div class="center"><hr width="80%" size="2"></div>
<img src="./Microprogramming_files/0708.cs-323003.png">
<div class="caption"><table cellspacing="6" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left">Figure 1.3: A simple bus-based data unit</td></tr>
</tbody></table></div>
<a name="fig:examplebus"></a>
<div class="center"><hr width="80%" size="2"></div></blockquote><p>For example consider a simple, <i>single bus</i> implementation
of a data unit in figure <a href="http://euler.mat.uson.mx/~havillam/ca/CS323/0708.cs-323003.html#fig:examplebus">1.3</a>.</p><p>There are a total of 16 registers, but only one can write to the bus
at any one time — hence it makes sense to encode all the register
read bits as a 4-bit word.</p><p>However, all the registers can read from the bus (register write)
simultaneously — so we could argue that these should be unencoded
— 16 bits.</p><p>However, this is a bit over the top, as we would hardly want to write
the same value into all the registers at once.</p><p>We would look at the architecture, and see if the instruction set
makes it reasonable to allow multiple register writes. Given the
single bus implementation, in most cases we are unlikely to gain
anything by allowing this. Hence in this case it makes sense to
encode the read bits as well. This would allow us to simultaneously
read and write to the bus, copying the contents of one register in a
single step.</p><h2 class="section"><a name="toc8"></a><a name="htoc13">1.4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rise and Fall of Microprogramming</h2><p>
<a name="sec:risefall"></a></p><p>Microprogramming has been a massively successful solution to the
problem of building controllers systematically, and was used (with
minor modifications) in the vast majority of processors from the mid
1960s to the late 1980s.</p><p>However, it has now been more-or-less completely superseded for
advanced processors. The reasons for the initial success and then the
decline are partly technological and partly concerned with attitudes
to software and hardware. While initially intended as a more
managable means of building controllers, a number of other
`advantages' become clear.</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize"><b>Easy to change</b> — microprograms could be relatively
easily changed, since they were in memory. In many machines,
microcode was explicitly loaded from a disk<sup><a name="text4" href="http://euler.mat.uson.mx/~havillam/ca/CS323/0708.cs-323003.html#note4">3</a></sup>. This meant that bugs could
easily be fixed, and machines could potentially be given
alternative instruction sets. Even in microprocessors,
bug-fixing a ROM was a lot easier and somewhat cheaper than
bug-fixing gate logic.</li><li class="li-itemize"><b>Easy to add functionality</b> — effectively, designers
found they could use the flexibility and ease of
construction/modification to increase the sophistication and
`power' of instruction sets. They could make more `powerful'
instructions by simply creating longer sequences of
microinstructions.</li></ul><p>All through the 60s and 70s instruction sets became more and more
sophisticated, culminating arguably in DEC's VAX series. Designers
thought that by providing a rich, sophisticated instruction set they
were making life easier for software engineers (particularly compiler
writers). During the late 60s the <i>software crisis</i> — the
failure of software projects to deliver — was a major issue, and the
reasons behind it were not initially well understood. (Software
projects still often do not deliver, but at least the community knows
why even if those directly involved do not.) One thing that was clear
however was that it was not possible to keep on writing low-level code
and meet demand — widespread use of high-level languages was
necessary and (many) compilers were not all that good. Designers of
instruction sets thought they were being helpful by trying to bridge
the so-called <i>semantic gap</i> between low- and high-level
languages. They did this by trying to provide relatively `high-level'
instruction sets.</p><p>However, starting in the early 80s, doubts crept in:</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize"><b>Constructs not quite right</b> — it proved impossible
in general, when looking at high-level languages as a whole,
to provide high-level instructions suitable for all of them.
So, often, the high-level instructions would not be useful, or
would need extra work to make them usable.</li><li class="li-itemize"><b>Too complex most of the time</b> — often when
instructions were sufficiently general they would be very
complex to use: too complex for most cases.</li><li class="li-itemize"><b>Performance</b> — this leads on from the previous
point. The high-level instructions were often slow. In lots
of cases, compiler writers found that short sequences of
simpler instructions were faster, so they used them instead.</li><li class="li-itemize"><b>Wasted resources</b> — when you have a situation where
you have a range of high-level instructions that are not being
used (much), then you are wasting resources. A lot of
hardware is sitting idle, which could instead be devoted to
making the simpler instructions faster.</li><li class="li-itemize"><b>Domination of control</b> — an increasing proportion of
hardware was going to implement control at the expense of
processing data. Approximately 70% of the chip area of a
late-70s microprocessor like the Motorola 68000 series was
control logic.</li></ul><p>There were always people with doubts about the appropriateness of
high-level instruction sets, but by the early 80s the influence of
those who thought complex instruction sets were bad was growing.
Their general view was that high-level instruction sets were providing
<i>solutions</i> when they should have been providing <i>tools</i>
or <i>primitives</i>. That is, they were saying to compiler
writers: <i>“You have this problem to do with generating code,
and we've solved it for you with this instruction.”</i> This led to the
problems listed above. Instead of solutions, the doubters said, they
should have been concentrating on basic building-blocks (tools) that
compiler writes could use to build their <i>own</i> solutions, more
closely matched to their specific problems.</p><p>A review of the actual behaviour of programs, the needs of compiler
writers, and improvements in compiler technology all helped to boost
the <i>RISC movement</i> (chapter <a href="http://euler.mat.uson.mx/~havillam/ca/CS323/0708.cs-323004.html#chap:risc_machines">2</a>). This
was further promoted by the growing use of <i>pipelining</i>
(chapter <a href="http://euler.mat.uson.mx/~havillam/ca/CS323/0708.cs-323006.html#chap:simple_pipelining">4</a>) and <i>superscalar
implementations</i> (chapter <a href="http://euler.mat.uson.mx/~havillam/ca/CS323/0708.cs-323009.html#chap:superscalar_processors">7</a>) which,
as we shall see, are much better suited to conceptually simpler
instruction sets — where all the instructions are the same length
and take the same amount of time to execute. Furthermore, the very
nature of modern pipelined processors is that they consist of
multiple, parallel stages, each with its own relatively-independent
and simple control logic — which are not well-suited to
microprogramming.</p><p>We will look at the issues surrounding the rise of RISCs in the next
chapter.
